Hello everyone!

I started this project is to help our volunteers and pilots for NWAL manage the many requests for free air transporation to medical treatment.  

I plan to develop a web-based system to allow patients in need to request travel assistance to and from far off medical facilities.  This project is in the infant stages and as time permits, i'll plan on working on it as i can.
